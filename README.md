# quiz-app

For this project, i used javascript, css and html. 
It was an independant project i worked on with the help of a udemy course and is inspired by my love for trivia and family game
nights on the playstation game Knowledge is Power but at a much more beginner level,
no sliming or iceing others around here!

It draws its API from Open Trivia DB and randomises 5 questions out of a possible 10. The player must guess the right answer and is then 
rewarded 10 points for each correct one, to which they can then add to the highscore board along with their name at the end.
Definitely fun to try with your friends and family (especially when you already know all the possible answers)!!
